# Nanahira language
maybe you're thinking "a compiler, written in javascript? really? are you stupid?", and yeah but:
* once the shits compiled runtime is the same, and i plan on making compilation zoomzoom fast
* i also plan on rewriting the compiler in this language once its ready

so what does it support? at the moment, jack all (that would be useful to you), but heres the list anyway:
* lexing
* parsing
  * variable assignments
  * function declarations (with parameters)
  * expressions
  * function calls (with arguments)
  * return statements
  * all these things are pretty inconsequential especially considering it doesn't actually generate code yet, but listing off a lot of things sounds impressive so get off my back
* code generation
  * literally it just generates a barebones assembly file with no code

code generation coming soon?

Coming up with a name is too hard so named after our queen ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
